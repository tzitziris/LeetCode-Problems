//Example 1: Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k,
//find the length of the longest subarray whose sum is less than or equal to k.
//This is the problem we have been talking about above. We will now formally solve it.

//Let's use an integer curr that tracks the sum of the current window.
//Since the problem wants subarrays whose sum is less than or equal to k,
// we want to maintain curr <= k. Let's look at an example where nums = [3, 1, 2, 7, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5] and k = 8.
